# Yaxreturns Exchange Integrations

A ``Node.js`` provided by https://www.yaxreturns.com/

---

Yax seeks to support all cryptocurrency exchanges. Unfortunately, this takes developer time and there are often API changes on these exchanges that can break our integrations with them. 

To help us out and to ensure that the exchanges you need are added to our service ASAP, we've made this ``Node.js`` library available so that you can help us fetch data from these API's or update our code when API's change.

In this repository, you'll find an ``example_exchange_pipeline.js`` file and a ``kraken_pipeline.js`` file, which show the basic process of fetching transaction data from an exchange API and formatting it to be inserted as transaction models in our database. If you're up for it, your task is to modify this code for any given exchange API that you'd like to see integrated on our platform.

High fives, and happy coding! If you have any questions, please reach out to support@yareturns.com. Let's make this a possibility together.
